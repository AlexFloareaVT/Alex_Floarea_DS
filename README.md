## Notes
This voicebank was trained with the "Multi-Dict" branch of DiffSinger. This is supported by the current beta of OpenUTAU. The following is a list of language tags used by "Alex Floarea -ETERNAL- for DiffSinger":

| Language | Tag |
| :----- | ---: |
| English | en/ |
| Japanese | ja/ |
| Chinese | zh/ |
| Korean | ko/ |
| French | fr/ |
| Spanish | es/ |
| Thai | th/ |

As well as the language tags there are a few extra phonemes available to use across all languages:

| Phoneme | Name | Usage |
| :----- | --- | ---: |
| SP | Silence | Denotes silent pauses |
| AP | Breaths | Denotes pauses with an intake of breath |
| cl | Plosive Modifier | This can be used after consonants to reign in their pronunciation a bit. |
| q | Glottal Stop | uh-oh [ah q ow] |
| vf | Vocal Fry | This can be added before vowels, and some consonants, paired with a low pitch curve/point, to add vocal fry |

The following phonemes are extras for the English language natively supported by the upcoming "DIFFS-EN+" phonemizer pending an update to OpenUTAU:

| Phoneme | Type | Usage |
| :----- | --- | ---: |
| ax | Vowel | again [**ax** g eh n] |
| dr | Consonant | dream [**dr** iy m] |
| tr | Consonant | train [**tr** ey n] |

The Thai language works through the regular "DIFFS" phonemizer as, as far as I'm aware, there isn't one specifically for Thai yet and French requires the Millefeuille DIFFS-FR phonemizer found on their website (linked below!).
